League of Legends auto accept matches 

Go to bathroom, drink some watter or get the door...it doesn'matter. For some reason, sometimes we need to get off the PC, while searching for a match. That's the reason why I created this bot.
It works using image analyse, so you don't get any ban from Riot, once it simulates a real person interaction (seeing the march warning, then clicking on accept button).
